Project: Medical Appointment Booking System
A system that allows:
i)Patients to register, log in, book appointments with doctors.
ii)Doctors/Admins to log in, view and approve/reject appointments.
iii)Email notifications and appointment history tracking.
1. Waterfall Model:
Description:
A linear and phase-by-phase model where each phase must be completed before moving to the next.
How it fits my project:
i)I already know the full requirements: roles, forms, flows.
ii) I can follow a step-by-step process: 
Requirements → Design → Implementation → Testing → Deployment.
Advantages:
i)Easy to manage and plan.
ii)Ideal for small academic projects with clear goals and short timelines.
Limitations:
i)Not flexible to changes once coding starts.
ii)Late discovery of issues (after testing).




2. Spiral Model:
Description:
A risk-driven, iterative model that cycles through planning, risk analysis, development, and evaluation.
How it fits my project:
i)I can break my system into cycles:
->1st Spiral: Login & Registration
->2nd Spiral: Booking system
->3rd Spiral: Approval mechanism
->4th Spiral: Email & history tracking
Advantages:
i)I can identify risks early (e.g., email delivery, appointment conflicts).
ii)Continuous refinement.
Limitations:
i)Slightly complex for small projects.
ii)Requires planning and documentation per cycle.
3. Incremental Model:
 Description:
Software is developed in small, working increments — each adding new functionality.
How it fits my project:
i)I can build and deliver features in parts:

->Registration/Login
-> Booking form
->Doctor approval
-> Email + history
Advantages:
i)Early partial versions available for review.
ii)Easier to test and debug.
Limitations:
I must design the full system architecture upfront.
4. Prototype Model:
 Description:
Focuses on building a prototype first to understand user requirements better.
How it fits my project:
i)I could create a quick HTML interface for:
->Booking form
->Dashboard layout
Advantages:
i)Immediate feedback.
ii)Helpful if the users are not sure what they want.
Limitations:
May lead to unrealistic expectations if the prototype looks “finished”.


5. Agile Model (Scrum-style):
Description:
A flexible, iterative model using short development cycles (sprints), with continuous feedback and adaptation.
How it fits my project:
i)I can split my work into weekly sprints:
->Sprint 1: Setup & login
->Sprint 2: Booking logic
->Sprint 3: Admin approval
->Sprint 4: Testing, notifications
 Advantages:
i)Flexible to changes.
ii)Continuous feedback.
 Limitations:
i)Requires regular meetings/reviews.
ii)May be too much overhead for solo developers.
